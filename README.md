MicrobesFlux 
-----------------

*MicrobesFlux* is a web-based platform designed for

 * genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction; and
 * constraint-based modeling for both metabolic steady and non-steady states.

MicrobesFlux is free, open-source software. It uses the [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) database (KGML and LIGAND) and empowered by cloud computation. It employs state-of-the-art optimization solvers, such as IPOPT, to solve large-scale flux-balance models.

MicrobesFlux processes the following unique characteristics:

 * intuitive and interactive metabolic model reconstruction,
 * users have flexibility to further customize metabolic models,
 * dynamic metabolism modeling support (dFBA), in addition to the static-state metabolism modeling capability (FBA)
