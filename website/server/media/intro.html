<p> 
    <b>MicrobesFlux</b> is a web-based platform designed for 
    <ul>
        <li> genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction; and </li>
        <li> constraint-based modeling for both metabolic steady and non-steady states. </li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p>
MicrobesFlux is free, open-source software. It uses the 


<a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">KEGG database</a> (KGML and LIGAND) and empowered by cloud computation. It employs  state-of-the-art optimization solvers, such as IPOPT, to solve large-scale flux-balance models. 
</p>

<p>
<b> MicrobesFlux</b> processes the following unique characteristics: 
<ul>
    <li> intuitive and interactive metabolic model reconstruction, </li>
    <li> users have flexibility to further customize  metabolic models, </li>
    <li> dynamic metabolism modeling support (dFBA), in addition to the static-state  metabolism modeling capability (FBA) </li>
</ul>
