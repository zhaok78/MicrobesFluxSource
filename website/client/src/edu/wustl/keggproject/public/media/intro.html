    <b>MicrobesFlux</b> is a web-based platform designed by Dr. Xueyang Feng and You Xu. It supports:
    <ul>
        <li> high-throughput metabolic model drafting; and </li>
        <li> constraint-based modeling for both metabolic steady and non-steady states. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
MicrobesFlux is free, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kegg-dfba/">open-source</a> software. It uses the <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">KEGG database</a> (KGML and LIGAND) and is empowered by cloud computation. It employs  state-of-the-art optimization solvers, such as IPOPT, to solve large-scale flux-balance models.

<b> MicrobesFlux</b> is implemented with the following unique characteristics: 
<ul>
    <li> high-throughput metabolic model generation, </li>
    <li> flexible, user-defined metabolic model reconstruction, </li>
    <li> dynamic metabolism modeling support (dFBA), in addition to the static-state  metabolism modeling capability (FBA) </li>
</ul>
