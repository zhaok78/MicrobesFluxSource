<h2> Future Work:  MicrobesFlux 2.0 </h2>
<p>
State-of-art flux analyses will be incorporated in MicrobesFlux 2.0: 

<ol>
<li> using the 13C-isotopomer labeling of metabolites (13C-MFA) to assist the genome-scale flux analysis; </li>
<li> integrating FBA with transcription analysis to improve model accuracy and reveal cell-wide metabolic regulations; </li>
<li> linking kinetic bioprocess models to flux analysis to understand dynamic metabolisms in response to process variables (such as nutrient concentrations and product inhibitions); </li>
<li> characterizing metabolisms in syntrophic microbial communities to capture metabolic interactions between different species.</li>
</ol>
